“OTOBI – means forest and is a Bengali word chosen by Late Nitun Kundu, one of the most renowned artist and sculptor and also the founder of Otobi Limited.”

Otobi, the leading furniture manufacturer and retailer in Bangladesh is the most preferred lifestyle solution brand because of its constant innovations, advanced technological expertise, manufacturing capacity in the widest range of furniture categories, largest distribution network and time tested service reputation.

From humble beginnings in 1975 in the corporate furniture realm to the spectacular escalation into the lifestyle giant that it is now, Otobi's story of success spans over four decades. With creative reinvention pulsating through the entire organization, Otobi has integrated the entire furniture solution platform in home, office, industrial and interior design through its operation.

Nitun Kundu, founder and late chairman started this organization with the urge to create products that none other could do. Now Otobi has turned into an institution of creativity and inspiration containing 5,120 members with the same intention as the maestro.
